比赛开始近几日来，一直有选手针对财务数据的历史发布时间、报告日期、数据所在截止日期等字段存在诸多疑问。
尤其是在发布时间和报告的延续性上多为关注。

Since the start of the competition, there were many questions from our contestants regarding information such as historical release time of financial data, the date of the report, the deadline of the data and other fields. To be more specific, a lot of attention was paid to the release time and continuity of reports.

为了满足选手们对历史报告披露的详尽了解需求，本次进行的财务数据更新改为PIT（Point In Time）处理的财务数据，
即详尽记录了报表历史的披露情况。
In order to respond to the needs from our contestants ― to understand the disclosure of historical reports, we have updated our financial data to the PIT (Point in Time) processed financial data, which recorded the disclosure of the history of reports.


举例说明：
For instance:

更新前的数据，针对同一报告的不同时间点披露，只记录了最新的publish_date，导致同一期的三大报表存在不同的发布时间,
更新后选手可以看到同一时间点披露的报表数据，以及之后更新披露的每条更新记录。
There may have many records, disclosed in different time, for the same period of report. Before the update, only the record with the latest publish_date was shown. So that the three kinds of financial statements in the same period may have different publish date.

After the update, contestants are able to view report data, disclosed from the same time point, as well as each updated record of this disclosure later.


选手们可以自行选择在自己的模型中统一选用最新数据，或者选用历史数据进行回测等等。
Notice: contestants are free to use the latest data in their models, or to use historical data for back-testing, etc.
